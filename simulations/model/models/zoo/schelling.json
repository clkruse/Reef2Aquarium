Each one thinks: \"If less than half of my neighbors are like me, I'll move somewhere else.\" And though everyone's OK with an equal neighborhood, when you hit [PLAY]... bam.\n\nThis may seem like a depressing outcome, but I took away a more hopeful message: evil systems can still be filled with *good people*. We just gotta be very, very clever, and compassionate, to help them find their goodness.\n\n(This model was made by Nobel Prize-winner, Thomas Schelling)",
